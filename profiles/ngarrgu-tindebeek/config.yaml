# in summary: trevor --> internet access with limited resources, ~25GB memory and 12 CPUs.
#             milan--> nominal computing nodes with up to  ~1TB high memory nodes and 64 cpus.
#             skylake--> nominal computing nodes with up to ~700 GB memory but 32 cpu max.
# Note max resources in link includes OS allocations, so requestes should be generally lower than the max.
